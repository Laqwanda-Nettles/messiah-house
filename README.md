# Messiah House Nonprofit Project

## Overview

Messiah House is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting individuals in need through various community-driven services. This project focuses on building a web presence that effectively communicates the organization's mission, services, and opportunities for involvement.

## My Contributions

- **Homepage Development:** Implemented key sections to introduce Messiah House and engage visitors.
  - **Hero Section:** A welcoming banner with a compelling message.
  - **Mission Statement:** Clearly outlines the nonprofitâ€™s purpose and values.
  - **Services Section:** Highlights the core programs and support provided by Messiah House.
  - **Get Involved Section:** Encourages user engagement with clear calls to action for volunteering and donations.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** and **React.js** for front-end development
- **Tailwind CSS**, **Custom CSS and Resets**, and **DaisyUI** for styling
- **Canva** for wireframe design

## Next Steps

- Expanding the website with additional pages such as an **About Us**, **Impact Stories**, and **Contact Page**.
